//Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
//There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

//sol:as there is only one duplicate number in the array therefore we can firstly sort and then look for adjacent element 
// if at any point an elemnt of array matches with the one adjacent to it we will call it duplicate

class Solution{
public:
    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        int val=nums[0];//initialised with initial element after sorting
        for(int i=1;i<nums.size();i++)
        {
            if (val==nums[i])// value of val start with first and is being compared
            {
                break;
            }
            else{// if the val value doesn't match we give it the value of that particular number
                val=nums[i];
            }
        }
        return val;
    }
